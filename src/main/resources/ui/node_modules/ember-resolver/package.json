  "readme": "# Ember Resolver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-resolver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-resolver)\n\n\nThis project is tracking a new resolver based on ES6 semantics that has been extracted from (and used by) the following projects:\n\n* [ember-cli](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli)\n* [ember-app-kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit)\n* [ember-appkit-rails](https://github.com/DavyJonesLocker/ember-appkit-rails)\n\n## Installation\n\nEmber-resolver was previously a bower package, but since v1.0.1, it has become an ember-cli addon, and should be installed with `ember install`:\n```\nember install ember-resolver\n```\n\nIf you're currently using ember-resolver v0.1.x in your project, you should uninstall it:\n```\nbower uninstall ember-resolver --save\n```\n\n_You can continue to use ember-resolver v0.1.x as a bower package, but be careful not to update it to versions greater than v1.0._\n\n## Addon Development\n\n### Installation\n\n* `git clone` this repository\n* `npm install`\n* `bower install`\n\n### Running\n\n* `ember server`\n* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.\n\n### Running Tests\n\n* `ember test`\n* `ember test --server`\n\n### Building\n\n* `ember build`\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit [http://www.ember-cli.com/](http://www.ember-cli.com/).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nAs mentioned above, `ember-resolver` is no longer a bower package.  If you're seeing a message like this:\n\n```\nUnable to find a suitable version for ember-resolver, please choose one:\n    1) ember-resolver#~0.1.20 which resolved to 0.1.21 and is required by ember-resolver#2.0.3\n    2) ember-resolver#~2.0.3 which resolved to 2.0.3 and is required by [APP_NAME]\n```\n\n... you probably need to update your application accordingly.  See aptible/dashboard.aptible.com#423 as an example of how to update.\n",
